My current goal is to re-design the "store board" to use a 32KB SRAM instead of the two banks of 16KB DRAM.<br>

I think this is the last remaining fault in my machine.<br>

Failing ... or succeeding ... that, I'd like to try at a 64KB external SRAM board.<br>

Sent SRAM Store Board prototype for fabrication<br>

Well, what a disaster that was.  Fixed my (obvious) mistakes and have sent the updated design for fabrication.<br>

My YouTube video playlist - note, most are my very early videos so probably a bit rough:<br>
